# Language-Translation
This is a capstone project that was carried out with Imperial College of London.
NLP workflows using both transformers and recurrent neural network was created to perform the translation of english language to German.

The original capstone project was developed using [LSTM](https://github.com/josepholaide/English2German-using-Attention-and-LSTM/blob/main/Using%20RNN/Neural_Translation_with_LSTM.ipynb) and later [Transformers](https://github.com/josepholaide/English2German-using-Attention-and-LSTM/blob/main/Using%20Transformer/Neural_Translation_English_German.ipynb) were adopted.
